#WRITE(●'◡'●)

Hey! If you like keeping track of your assignments and also love taking minimalistic notes, then you might like this application which I call as "WRITE". 

WRITE enables you to add all necessary information about your assignments like deadlines, corresponding subject and also attach a PDF related to your assignment(describing the tasks i guess?). 
Based on the priority of your assignments, in case they are important, you can easily see all the marked as important ones on your home page in increasing order of their deadlines (makes it easier to know which is nearly due!). 

Moreover, WRITE also provides the facility of adding notes. You can type anything in it with some title for your note and also add a nice cover image to it. 
It just makes this app a bit more fun to use and enhances the aesthetic of your note view page. 

I am still going to add some more features to it in the future so that it becomes much more easier to use. 

Main frameworks that I used for the Backend were : **Node.js, express, MongoDB, JavaScript**. 

For Frontend I simply made use of **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and a little bit of **Bootstrap**!

The app is deployed on heroku, you can click on the link given to view app.
